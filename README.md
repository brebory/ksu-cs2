KSU CS23001 SUMMER 2013
=======================

This is my classwork for CS II: Data Structures and Abstractions at Kent State University.

I've decided to implement these projects in both C++ (as required) and Go, in order to build my understanding of both languages.

## PROJECTS

1. Log: Parse apache logs, output in a structured format.
   * C++: log_view library
   * Go: apachelog package
